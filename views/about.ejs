    <h4>1. Who I Am</h4>
    <p>
      Hi! It's my pleasure to see you here. I'm <strong>Shivang Amin</strong>, a Networking and IoT Engineer currently pursuing a degree in
      <strong>Network and IT Security</strong> at Ontario Tech University.
      I’m driven by curiosity — how networks communicate, how devices connect, and how security can make systems more trustworthy.
      I love diving into the technical details while keeping an eye on the bigger picture of how technology impacts people and businesses.
      some of my key strengths include problem-solving, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning.
